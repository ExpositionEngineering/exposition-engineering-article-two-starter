## üèÅ Introduction

This project invites you to use exposition engineering tools (e.g., VS Code and
artificial intelligence writing assistants) to use an artificial intelligence
(AI) writing assistant to automatically write an article of between one and two
pages on **the future of the podcasting industry**. In addition to writing all
of the required content in the file [writing/article.md](writing/article.md),
you will continue to use `git` and GitHub and check the writing in a Markdown
file through the use of tools like the
[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs the
automated grading checks provided by
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).

Please note that the content provided in the `README.md` file for this GitHub
repository is an overview of the project and thus may not include the details
for every step needed to successfully complete every project deliverable. This
means that you may need to schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours to discuss aspects of this project. Finally, it is important to
point out that your repository for this project was created from the GitHub
repository template called
[exposition-engineering-article-two-starter](https://github.com/ExpositionEngineering/exposition-engineering-article-two-starter);
you can check this repository for any updates to this project's documentation
or source code!

## ü§ù Seeking Assistance

Even though the course instructor will have covered all of the concepts central
to this project before you start to work on it, please note that not every
detail needed to successfully complete the assignment will have been covered
during prior classroom sessions. This is by design as an important skill that
you must practice as an exposition engineer is to search for and then understand
and ultimately apply the technical writing content found in additional resources.

## üõ´ Project Overview

This assignment invites you to use an AI writing assistant to complete an
article of between one and two pages on **the future of the podcasting
industry**. Please note that all of the following aspects of your article must
be written directly by an AI writing assistant. The only role that you can play
when writing this article is to issue prompts to the AI writing assistant. This
means that you may not directly edit any of the content that the AI writing
assistant produces. In addition to meeting all of the baseline requirements
that are enforced through automated checks run in GitHub Actions, your article
must have all of the following components that are exclusively written by AI:

- **Title and Theme**: The article should establish a viewpoint on a theme
within the specified topic for this article. The viewpoint for the article
should be reflected in a clear and compelling title that highlights the purpose
of the article.

- **Introduction Section**: The article should contain an introduction section
that establishes the audience for the article, clearly states its viewpoint,
and provides a brief overview of the claims that it will make.

- **Body Sections**: The article should contain multiple body sections that
make self-contained points while featuring clear transitions between the main
topics.

- **Conclusion Section**: The article should contain a conclusion section that
reiterates the article's viewpoint and provides a summary of the main claims.

Importantly, this assignment also requires you to provide a list of the AI
writing assistants that you used to complete this assignment and a detailed
explanation of how you used those tools to finish the assignment. You must also
answer the following questions as part of your reflection on this experience:

- What were the strengths of the AI generated article?
- What were the weakness of the AI generated article?
- What are at least two credible references that support the claims of the AI generated article?
- What are at least two credible references that refute the claims of the AI generated article?
- What was your overall experience when using the AI writing assistant to complete this assignment?
- After this experience, what do you think is the future or writing at Allegheny College?

The completion of this assignment will take place over approximately one and a
half weeks and follow this schedule:

- **Week One, Class One**: Develop an idea for the article within the stated
theme and start to use an AI writing assistant to complete the article. Please
recall that, while you are supposed to revise the prompts that you submit to the
AI writing assistant, you are not allowed to edit the content produced by the AI
writing assistant. With that said, the only reason for which you can edit the
content produced by the AI writing assistant is if it leads to a mistake that
causes the build in GitHub Actions to fail.

- **Week One, Class Two**: Finish using the AI writing assistant to complete the
writing assignment and then complete the additional reflection questions without
any use of an AI writing assistant. Make sure that you have completed all of the
required parts of the assignment and your project has a passing build in GitHub
Actions before the final deadline.

This assignment will be due at the end of the day for **Week Two, Class One**.

## üêä Project Assessment

This article will be assessed according to the following criteria established
by the faculty members who assess writing assignments submitted as a part of
the First-Year/Sophomore writing and speaking program:

- **Audience**: Awareness of an intended audience that fuels the article's
delivery of ideas that are relevant to and suitable for that audience;
- **Purpose**: Communication of purpose that is relevant to an audience and an
occasion that is customized by the author and tailored to the article's
purpose;
- **Organization**: Employment of effective organization patterns and
techniques that signpost for the reader the article's structure and the
relationships among its key ideas;
- **Sources**: Use of high-quality, credible, and relevant sources that support
the development of the article's main claims;
- **Context**: Articulates a claim in a complex and nuanced fashion that
accounts for different contexts and assumptions.

Please see the course instructor for more details about the assessment rubric
in use to assess each of these categories. With that said, for each of the
above categories, the course instructor will classify the article into one of
the following levels:

- **Not Evident**: The article does not demonstrate evidence for the criterion.
- **Developing**: The article demonstrates some evidence for the criterion.
- **Proficient**: The article demonstrates a proficient level for the criterion.
- **Exemplary**: The article demonstrates an exemplary level for the criterion.

It is important to note that the primary assessment focus for this article is
the student-written content that reflects on the use of AI writing assistants.
Please keep in mind the following reminders as you consider how the course
instructor will assess whether or not the final version of your project meets
additional baseline requirements related to, for instance, the use of Markdown:

- If you have already installed the
[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs the
automated grading checks provided by
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) you can, from the
repository's base directory, run the automated grading checks by typing
`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`.
- You may also review the output from running GatorGrader in GitHub Actions.
Please note that if all of the GatorGrader checks do not pass, then your GitHub
Actions build will not pass either. You need to make sure that you have a
passing build in GitHub Actions before the project's due date.
- The GitHub repository that houses this project has a GitHub Actions
configuration that will report to you through the GitHub Actions tab a summary
of the key results from running the assessment. You can check this tab to
quickly see which the status of the GatorGrader checks and to review a report
about the coverage of the test suite that accompanies the project.
- Don't forget that you must provide all of the required responses to the
technical writing prompts in the `writing/article.md` file.
- Please make sure that you completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
labels from all of the provided source code and technical writing. This means
that instead of only deleting and/or rewriting the `TODO` marker from the file
you should delete the `TODO` marker and the entire prompt and then add your own
content to demonstrate that you understand all aspects of this project.

## Effective Exposition Engineering

Students who create the any type of writing, speaking, or peer review should
ensure the creation of a high-quality final product. While students are
permitted to use a wide variety of exposition engineering tools, such as
grammar checkers, idea generators, text writers, and text revisers, including
intelligent systems that leverage large language models like GitHub Copilot or
ChatGPT, they must take responsibility for all of the content that they submit
for this course, including artifacts that are automatically generated,
enhanced, or reviewed by a software tool. Any student who uses exposition
engineering tool(s) should also include a statement at the end of their article
that clearly explains their chosen tools and workflows.

Students who uses software tools to create content are responsible for citing
their sources and demonstrating their understanding of it during the in-person
discussions. Moreover, all students in the class are responsible for all of the
written documentation submitted to the GitHub repository that hosts the course
projects, including any tool-generated written artifacts. This means that every
student should be able to answer questions, during either an in-person or
online discussion, about any technical or professional content, including that
which was automatically generated by a software tool.

Students who are effective exposition engineers also pledge to abide by the [ACM
Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).
Unless the students in this course furnish a different governing contract, they
also pledge to follow the principles espoused by exemplary technical
organizations, such as [Oxide Computer](https://oxide.computer/) and its public
statement of [mission and principles](https://oxide.computer/principles).
